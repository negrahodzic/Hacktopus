# Greenovate Hub: Project Documentation

## üåç Framing the Problem

### What is the problem we're trying to solve?

The green economy is growing rapidly, but there's a massive **access problem**. While the world needs to double its green talent by 2050 to meet net-zero goals, the people who could fill these roles are being left behind.

**The specific problems are:**

1. **Lack of Representation**: Only 5-7% of clean-energy workers are from ethnic-minority backgrounds, despite these communities often being most affected by climate change.

2. **No Career Guidance**: 70% of young people have never received green-career guidance, meaning they don't even know these opportunities exist.

3. **Invisible Barriers**: Traditional career platforms assume everyone has the same starting point - they don't address real barriers like lack of networks, financial constraints, or unfamiliarity with "green" industries.

4. **Scattered Resources**: Information about green careers, training, funding, and mentorship exists but is spread across dozens of different websites and organizations.

### Who does it affect?

**Primary Impact**: Black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities who face systemic barriers to accessing green career opportunities.

**Secondary Impact**: 
- First-generation college graduates who lack professional networks
- People from lower-income backgrounds who can't afford unpaid internships
- Career changers who don't know how their existing skills translate to green jobs
- Young people in areas with limited green job visibility

**Real People**: We created three personas based on real experiences:
- **Jamal Patel**: 23, Environmental Science graduate struggling to break into the green sector despite his qualifications
- **Aisha Rahman**: 26, Policy Analyst wanting to transition to climate policy but lacking connections
- **Rohan Singh**: 29, Solar Installer looking to advance to project management roles

## üí° Idea Explanation

### What is our idea?

**Greenovate Hub** is a comprehensive platform that reimagines access to green careers specifically for underrepresented communities. Instead of just listing jobs, we create a complete support ecosystem.

### How does it fix the problem?

**1. Personalized Assessment & Guidance**
- Interactive assessment tool that maps your existing skills to green career opportunities
- Shows you're not starting from zero - you already have valuable, transferable skills
- Provides personalized career pathways based on your background and goals

**2. Removes Information Barriers**
- All resources in one place: jobs, training, funding, mentorship
- Plain language explanations of what different green careers actually involve
- Real salary ranges and entry requirements for transparency

**3. Community-Driven Development**
- Built FOR underrepresented communities, not just ABOUT them
- Community feedback system where users shape platform development
- Peer networking and experience sharing

**4. Practical Support**
- Direct connections to mentors from similar backgrounds
- Information about grants and funding specifically for underrepresented groups
- Childcare-friendly training options and flexible learning paths

**5. Confidence Building**
- Success stories from people who look like you
- Skills-based approach that highlights your strengths
- Step-by-step guidance that doesn't assume prior knowledge

## üîß Implementation

### How do all the pieces fit together?

**Frontend Architecture:**
- **Next.js 14** with React for the main application
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with custom Octopus Energy brand colors
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better development experience
- **Responsive design** ensuring accessibility across all devices

**Key Components:**

1. **Assessment Wizard** (`modal-wizard.tsx`)
   - 10-step interactive assessment
   - Skills evaluation across 8 green career domains
   - Personalized results and recommendations
   - PDF export functionality for users to save their results

2. **Green Skills Pyramid** (`pyramid.tsx`)
   - Visual representation of career progression
   - Interactive tiers showing different experience levels
   - Detailed information about roles at each level

3. **Community Features**
   - Feedback submission system
   - Community ideas voting platform
   - Peer networking components

4. **Accessibility** (`accessibility-context.tsx`)
   - Screen reader support
   - Keyboard navigation
   - High contrast mode
   - Font size adjustment

**Data Management:**
- **Static JSON files** for configuration and learning content
- **Local state management** with React hooks
- **Context API** for global state (accessibility settings)

**Current Architecture:**
```
Frontend (Next.js) ‚Üí Static Data (JSON) ‚Üí User Interface
```

**File Structure:**
```
app/greenovate-hub/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx (Main landing page)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modal-wizard.tsx (Assessment tool)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyramid.tsx (Career progression visual)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ steps/ (Individual assessment steps)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ accessibility-controls.tsx

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json (Platform configuration)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ learning.json (Career and learning data)
```

### Does your frontend make requests to your backend?

**Currently**: No backend - the platform runs entirely on the frontend with static data. This was an intentional design choice for the hackathon to focus on user experience and rapid prototyping.

**Data Sources:**
- Career information stored in `data/learning.json`
- Platform configuration in `data/config.json`
- User responses stored in browser local storage
- Community feedback simulated with local state

### Where does your database fit in?

**Current State**: No database - all data is static or stored locally in the browser.

**Future Database Design** (see Next Steps):
- User profiles and assessment results
- Community feedback and voting
- Mentor-mentee matching data
- Job listings and applications
- Learning progress tracking

## üöß Challenges

### What did we struggle with?

**1. Balancing Simplicity with Comprehensiveness**
- **Challenge**: Green careers span dozens of industries - how do you make it comprehensive without overwhelming users?
- **Solution**: Created a tiered approach with the pyramid structure, allowing users to start simple and dive deeper as needed.

**2. Accessibility Implementation**
- **Challenge**: Ensuring the platform works for users with different abilities and technical comfort levels.
- **Solution**: Built accessibility features from the ground up, not as an afterthought. Added screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and visual adjustments.

**3. Dark Theme Consistency**
- **Challenge**: Maintaining readable text and proper contrast across all components while keeping the Octopus Energy brand aesthetic.
- **Solution**: Created a systematic color scheme with `octopus-dark`, `octopus-white`, `octopus-green`, and `octopus-pink` classes, then methodically applied them across all components.

**4. Community Feature Design**
- **Challenge**: How do you create meaningful community engagement without building complex social features?
- **Solution**: Focused on structured feedback and voting systems rather than open forums, making it easier to moderate and more focused on platform improvement.

**5. Assessment Tool Complexity**
- **Challenge**: Creating an assessment that's thorough enough to be useful but not so long that users abandon it.
- **Solution**: Broke it into 10 digestible steps with clear progress indicators and the ability to save/resume progress.

### How did we overcome these challenges?

**Iterative Design**: We built, tested, and refined each component multiple times based on user flow testing.

**Component-Based Architecture**: Breaking everything into reusable components made it easier to maintain consistency and fix issues across the platform.

**User-Centered Approach**: Every design decision was evaluated against the question: "Does this help or hinder someone from an underrepresented background accessing green careers?"
